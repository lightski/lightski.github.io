Hello! What's this blog all about?

I've been interested in computer security/ hacking for the last seven years, but I never really acted on my urge. What's worse, I have a copy of Jon Erickson's [*Hacking: the Art of Exploitation*](https://www.nostarch.com/hacking2.htm) on my shelf and waiting to go. The book has been staring at me-- daring me to start something. So today I decided, hey why not, let's start this thing.

To help my motivation (and desire for validation) I've decided to blog about my adventures. Starting tomorrow, and going for the next month, I'm going to set aside ninety minutes daily. Each day I will read and code using *Hacking: the Art of Exploitation* and then blog about what I learned. 

If that's your thing, welcome.
